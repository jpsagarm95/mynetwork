Transmit the packet based on the Window conditions. Start the timeout timer for this packet’s sequence
number. The timeout is set to 300 ms for the first 10 packets and then 2 × RT T ave (in milliseconds) for all
other packets.
Process the next packet (when available) and transmit it if the sender window is not exhausted, i.e. the
total number of unacknowledged packets is at most WINDOW_SIZE. Given an n-bit sequence number, the
maximum window size will be 2 n−1 for Selective Repeat.
4. If an ACK packet arrives, process it, update local state variables and cancel timers corresponding to acknowl-
edged packets. Remove the packet from the Transmit Buffer. Note that selective ACKs are used.
For each sequence number acknowledged, calculate the Round-trip-Time (RTT) for the packet and update the
average RTT (RT T ave ) for the packets acknowledged so far.
5. If a timer expires, re-transmit only the unacknowledged packet.
The sender terminates after MAX_PACKETS (a command-line parameter) have been successfully ACKNOWL-
EDGED (OR) if the maximum retransmission attempts for any sequence number exceeds 10.
Summary of Command Line Options: The command line options provided to the sender are listed below:
• -d – Turn ON Debug Mode (OFF if -d flag not present)
• -s string – Receiver Name or IP address.
• -p integer – Receiver’s Port Number
• -n integer – Sequence Number Field Length (in bits)
• -L integer – MAX_PACKET_LENGTH, in bytes
• -R integer – PACKET_GEN_RATE, in packets per second
• -N integer – MAX_PACKETS
• -W integer – WINDOW_SIZE (Assume that SWS = RWS)
• -B integer – BUFFER_SIZE
